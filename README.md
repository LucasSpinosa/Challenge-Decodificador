#  Text Decoder Challenge - Oracle Next Education / Alura

## About

This repository contains my version of the web page proposed by the 1st Challenge of the Oracle Next Education program, offered by Oracle and Alura.

This application can code vowels, transforming sentences into secret messages. It can also decode them back to their original form.

The encryptation works as following:

   - `'a' becomes 'ai'`
   - `'e' becomes 'enter'`
   - `'i' becomes 'imes'`
   - `'o' becomes 'ober'`
   - `'u' becomes 'ufat'`

Conditions:

   - Only works on lowercase letters.
   - Special characters and letters with accents are not permitted.
